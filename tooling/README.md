# tooling

here goes developer tooling to do various handy things

to test sending requests, you can use the verb.* files in your preferred way, or import
the bruno collection with [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/)

to inspect requests, self-hosted tools like 
[request-baskets](qkF8kFv_09Hy2GWsWoESISBmhyEM_pItZPbegIm8vvRf) exist (they also have
a hosted version at https://rbaskets.in/ )
